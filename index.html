        <p class="line" style="margin-top:18px">You once said "O God. Please make this child understand this trouble
          maker better." Naanu adu odi nagtidde. But honestly? I think nange, nimma bagge nimge gotthirodikintalu jaasti
          gothu. 😂</p>
        <p class="line" style="margin-top:14px">I know that when you dodge a question, it's because the answer scares
          you a little. I know when you say "Lol" you're actually blushing on the other side and trying so hard to act
          normal. And I know your heart is wayyy bigger than your words, because the way you said "I LOVE YOU" that
          night, even you didn't expect it would come out like that, right? 🥹</p>
        <p class="line" style="margin-top:14px">You worry about your thesis, but you spend your nights making me smile
          like a <span class="crossed">mental</span> <span class="replaced">happy idiot</span>. You sit in class
          thinking about me while your HOD is literally watching you lol. You send me reels at 1 AM because you can't
          sleep without saying one more thing. You are literally the cutest <span class="crossed">disaster</span> <span
            class="replaced">miracle</span> I've ever seen.</p>
        <p class="line" style="margin-top:14px">You call me "Manager", and honey, that is hands down the most beautiful
          job title anyone has ever given me. Because managing your chaos, your midnight questions, your "Bii Bii Bii"
          followed by "Wait please", that's the only job I never, EVER want to quit. Ee job nange saaaku, bere yenu
          beda. 😂❤️</p>
        <p class="line" style="margin-top:14px">You asked me will I get bored when you're here, right? BORED?? Of YOU??
          The girl who made me smile so much that my family stares at my face while I eat?? The weirdo whose energy made
          my Instagram feed turn into full love reels?? The one who worries about my sleep more than her own thesis
          deadlines?? Howdu nimma jothe bore aagatte andre naanu devru ne aagi irbeku lol 😂</p>
        <p class="line" style="margin-top:14px">Never. Not in this lifetime. Not in seven lifetimes. Ee janmakke beda.
        </p>
        <p class="line" style="margin-top:14px">You told me "Haha. You wont get any chance for refund." Good. Because I
          was never planning to return the most beautiful headache that God ever gave me. No return, no exchange, no
          refund. You're stuck with me now, <span class="replaced">princess</span> 😂♥️</p>
